I have attached my web application project in the GitHub link:
üëâ https://github.com/Mmithraa2523/voting_system

Currently, the project has the following issues that need to be fixed:

1. Face Detection Issue

Even when a fake face is provided, the system still shows ‚ÄúVoter verified successfully‚Äù and allows voting.

This should be fixed so that only valid registered faces are verified.

Functional Requirements for Face Detection:

Capture Face

Open webcam when user clicks "Start Camera".

Detect a face in the live stream.

Draw a bounding box around the detected face.

Save Face Encodings

Extract 128-D face encodings from captured images.

Save encodings in the database or a folder for later recognition.

Authenticate Face

Compare the live face encoding against stored encodings.

If match (distance < 0.6) ‚Üí show "Authentication Successful".

If no match ‚Üí show "Authentication Failed".

Optional Features

Allow up to 5 reference images per voter for higher accuracy.

Add anti-spoofing (blink/head movement detection).

Save all attempts (success/failure) with timestamp and image in logs.

2. Email Verification Issue

Currently, email alerts are not being sent.

Fix this so that email notifications work properly.

Email Alert Requirements:

On successful voting (face matches):

Show green success alert on screen.

Send an email notification to the voter.

On fake face detection (face mismatch):

Show red alert on screen.

Play a beep sound.

Send an email notification for security.

3. Polling System Issue

Candidate and party images are not visible during voting (only names are shown).

Fix image display so that voters can clearly see both candidate names and their images during the polling process.

‚ö° Project Objectives (Most Important)

Accurate Face Detection for voter verification.

Fully working Email Verification/Alerts system.

Clear Candidate and Party Image display in the polling system.

Both Face Detection and Email Verification must function properly as they are the core features of the project.
